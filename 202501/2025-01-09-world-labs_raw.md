Fei-Fei Li

Fei-Fei Li is a world-renowned technology visionary in AI, as a scientist, professor, scholar and industry leader. She is the inaugural Sequoia Professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, and Founding Co-Director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute. She served as the Director of Stanford’s AI Lab from 2013 to 2018. During her sabbatical from Stanford she was Vice President at Google and served as Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud. Her groundbreaking work on ImageNet, the first big training and benchmarking dataset in AI, was instrumental in catalyzing the onset of modern AI.

### Justin Johnson

Justin Johnson is the creator of real-time style transfer, which was deployed by Meta, Snap, and Prisma. He is a faculty member of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Michigan, and formerly a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Meta. Justin co-created the legendary Stanford computer vision and deep learning course CS231n as a graduate student working with Fei-Fei.

### Christoph Lassner

Christoph Lassner is the developer of [Pulsar](https://christophlassner.de/publication/pulsar/), an efficient sphere-based differentiable renderer that paved the way for 3D Gaussian Splatting. His work in scalable real-time neural rendering brought real-time NeRFs to VR and Unreal Engine. Previously, he served as a Staff Research Scientist Manager at Meta Reality Labs Research and as a Lead Scientist at Epic Games.

### Ben Mildenhall

Ben Mildenhall is a co-creator of the [neural radiance field (NeRF) method](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf) which revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis by introducing a method to represent and render complex scenes with photorealistic quality using implicit neural representations. Ben is also a former Senior Research Scientist at Google.
